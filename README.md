# quantum-playground
A landing point for experimentation with Quantum computing and algorithms


# Setup
<b>It is recommended to use a python virtual environment for this repo</b>

Note as of now tensorflow-quantum requires python 3.9 at the latest. Best way to handle changing python version is pyenv.

Run the following


- git clone https://github.com/Christian-Prather/quantum-playground.git
- cd quantum-playground
- python3 -m virtualenv .env
- source .env/bin/activate
- pip3 install -r requirements.txt
